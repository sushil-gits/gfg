Stepwise Explanation of startStation Function
The function startStation determines the starting gas station from which we can complete the circular journey in a gas station problem. If completing the journey is not possible, it returns -1.

Step 1: Initialize Variables
totalgas = 0: To store the total amount of gas available across all stations.

totalcost = 0: To store the total cost required to travel across all stations.

currgas = 0: Keeps track of the gas balance while traversing stations.

start = 0: Represents the candidate starting station.

Step 2: Iterate Over Each Station
Loop runs from 0 to gas.size() - 1
For each station i:

Add gas[i] to totalgas (total available gas).

Add cost[i] to totalcost (total required gas).

Update currgas as:

currgas
+
=
gas
[
ùëñ
]
‚àí
cost
[
ùëñ
]
currgas+=gas[i]‚àícost[i]
Check if currgas < 0

This means we can't reach the next station from start.

Set start = i + 1 (try the next station as the new starting point).

Reset currgas = 0.

Step 3: Final Check
If totalgas < totalcost, return -1 (Not enough gas to complete the circuit).

Otherwise, return start (the valid starting station).
